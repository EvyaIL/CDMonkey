# Deployment Success - Express-Free Solution

## Issue Resolved
The initial deployment error "Cannot find module 'express'" has been successfully resolved by implementing an Express-free solution.

## Key Changes Made
1. Implemented a standalone Node.js server that:
   - Uses only built-in Node.js modules (http, fs, path)
   - Properly serves static files from the build directory
   - Handles SPA routing
   - Includes a health check endpoint

2. Configuration Updates:
   - Updated app.yaml with correct build and run commands
   - Unified server.js and standalone-server.js to use the same Express-free implementation
   - Configured proper static file serving with MIME type support

## Current Status
- ✅ Server running successfully on port 8080
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ Static file serving working
- ✅ No dependency on Express

## Health Check Logs
```
Server running on port 8080
Health check available at: http://localhost:8080/health.json
Multiple successful GET /health.json requests with 200 status
```

## Deployment Configuration
- Build Command: `npm ci && npm run build`
- Run Command: `node server.js`
- Node Version: 20.x
- Port: 8080

## Notes
- The solution now uses only built-in Node.js modules, eliminating external dependencies
- Both server.js and standalone-server.js are identical to ensure consistency
- SPA routing is handled by serving index.html for unknown routes
