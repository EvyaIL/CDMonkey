## Automated SEO Tools Usage

### Sitemap Generation
To automatically generate a new sitemap.xml file:
```bash
node generate-sitemap.js
```
This will create an updated sitemap.xml in the public directory with current timestamps and content.

### Google Search Console Submission
To submit your sitemap to Google Search Console programmatically:
```bash
node submit-sitemap.js
```
Before running this script:
1. Create a Google Cloud project and enable the Search Console API
2. Create a service account with appropriate permissions
3. Download the service account key file and save as `google-api-credentials.json`
4. Add the service account as an owner to your Google Search Console property

## SEO Helper Utilities

We've created a comprehensive `seo-helper.js` file with utilities for implementing structured data:

### Available Functions:
- `generateProductSchema(product)` - Generates Product schema for product pages
- `generateBreadcrumbSchema(breadcrumbs)` - Creates BreadcrumbList schema
- `generateFAQSchema(faqItems)` - Creates FAQPage schema with Question/Answer
- `generateArticleSchema(post)` - Creates BlogPosting schema for blog content
- `addStructuredData(schemaData)` - Adds schema to document head
- `updateMetaTags(metaData)` - Updates page meta tags dynamically

Usage example:
```jsx
// In a product page component
useEffect(() => {
  if (product) {
    const schema = generateProductSchema(product);
    addStructuredData(schema);
  }
}, [product]);
```

## Google Search Console Submission Steps

To submit your sitemap to Google Search Console:

1. Log in to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Add your property if not already added (https://monkeyz.co.il/)

4. In the left sidebar, navigate to "Sitemaps"
5. Enter "sitemap.xml" in the "Add a new sitemap" field and click "Submit"
