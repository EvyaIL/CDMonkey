# DigitalOcean Deployment Fix

This file explains the fixes made to resolve deployment issues on DigitalOcean App Platform.

## Issues Fixed

1. **`react-scripts: not found` Error**
   - Added react-scripts to global installation in Dockerfile
   - Created a custom build script (do-build.sh) that installs react-scripts if missing
   - Modified package.json to use serve for production start

2. **Health Check Failures**
   - Added a proper health.json file in public directory
   - Created health check endpoint at /health.json
   - Updated health check configuration in app.yaml
   - Added more reliable health check in Dockerfile

3. **Connection Refused on Port 8080**
   - Updated app.yaml to specify correct HTTP port
   - Added express server as fallback if serve fails
   - Updated CMD in Dockerfile to have fallback options

## Key Changes

1. **Frontend app.yaml**:
   - Changed from static site to service
   - Added health check configuration
   - Added proper HTTP port configuration

2. **Dockerfile**:
   - Added curl for better health checks
   - Added express as a fallback server
   - Improved the CMD to be more resilient

3. **Package.json**:
   - Updated scripts to use serve in production
   - Added express to dependencies

4. **New Files**:
   - `health.json`: For health checks
   - `server.js`: Express fallback server
   - `do-build.sh`: Custom build script for DigitalOcean

## Notes for Future Deployments

- Always ensure react-scripts is available globally in production
- Always include a health check endpoint
- Use a fallback server option in case the primary server fails
- Test health check locally before deploying
