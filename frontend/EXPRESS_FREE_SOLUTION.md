# Express-free Deployment Solution for DigitalOcean

This solution completely eliminates the dependency on Express.js, using Node.js's built-in HTTP module instead. This approach is more reliable for DigitalOcean deployments because:

1. It has no external dependencies
2. It doesn't require npm install to run
3. It's a single self-contained file

## Key Changes:

1. Created `standalone-server.js` - A complete server using only Node.js built-in modules
2. Updated app.yaml to use this standalone server
3. Simplified the deployment process

## How It Works:

The standalone server implements all the necessary functionality:
- Static file serving from the build directory
- Health check endpoint (/health.json)
- SPA routing (fallback to index.html)

This approach completely bypasses the "Cannot find module 'express'" error by not using Express at all.

## Deployment Process:

1. The build script compiles the React app
2. The standalone server is copied to the right location
3. Node.js runs the standalone server directly

If you need to switch back to the Express implementation, simply change the app.yaml file to use the previous configuration.
