# DigitalOcean Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

This guide outlines the changes made to fix deployment issues with the React application on DigitalOcean App Platform.

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **`serve: not found` error**
   - Added multiple fallback mechanisms for running the server
   - Ensured `serve` is installed both globally and locally
   - Created multiple startup scripts with diagnostics

2. **Health check failures**
   - Extended initial delay for health checks to allow app to start
   - Added multiple health check endpoints (`/health.json`, `/health`)
   - Created fallback express server when serve fails

## Deployment Strategy

The deployment now uses a multi-layered approach:

1. First, it tries multiple methods to run the app using `serve`
2. If all `serve` attempts fail, it falls back to an Express server
3. The Express server has built-in diagnostics to help troubleshoot issues

## Files Modified

1. **Build Scripts:**
   - `do-build-simplified.sh` - Enhanced with better diagnostics and fallbacks
   - `do-build-express.sh` - Added as a pure Express.js alternative

2. **Server Scripts:**
   - `start.sh` - Complete rewrite with multiple fallback mechanisms
   - `server.js` - Enhanced with better error handling
   - `build-server.js` - Added for in-place running inside build directory

3. **Configuration:**
   - `app.yaml` - Updated health check settings
   - `production-package.json` - Updated with more dependencies and scripts

## Testing Your Deployment

After deploying, verify these endpoints:

- `/health.json` - Should return a JSON response with `{"status":"healthy"}`
- `/health` - Should return a simple HTML page

## Troubleshooting Next Steps

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check DigitalOcean logs for any startup errors
2. Try using the express-only build script: `do-build-express.sh`
3. Increase `initial_delay_seconds` in health check configuration
4. Verify that port 8080 is not being blocked by any security settings

## Reference

The scripts are designed to output extensive diagnostics at startup. Look for:
- Directory contents listing
- Node and NPM versions
- Server startup methods tried
- Health check responses

These should help pinpoint any remaining issues with the deployment.
