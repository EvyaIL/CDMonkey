# DigitalOcean Deployment Summary

## Important Note on DigitalOcean Access

⚠️ **DigitalOcean App Platform only has access to the specific directories you deploy:**

- For the backend: Only files within the `backend/` directory
- For the frontend: Only files within the `frontend/` directory

Any configuration files or scripts outside these directories will **not be available** during deployment or runtime!

## Key Configuration Changes

### 1. Backend Configuration

- Updated `.do/app.yaml` to use `.` as source directory (since DigitalOcean will be inside the backend folder)
- Added health check endpoint at `/health` in main.py
- Added `check_deployment.py` script inside the backend folder
- Ensured all required files are present in the backend directory

### 2. Frontend Configuration

- Updated `.do/app.yaml` to use `.` as source directory (since DigitalOcean will be inside the frontend folder)
- Added `check_deployment.js` script inside the frontend folder
- Confirmed build process is configured correctly

## Deployment Steps

### Backend Deployment

1. In DigitalOcean App Platform:
   - Create a new app
   - Connect to your GitHub repository
   - Select the `backend` directory
   - Use build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Use run command: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
   - Configure environment variables (see backend/.env.template)

2. Verify deployment:
   - Check `/health` endpoint
   - Test API with Swagger at `/docs`

### Frontend Deployment

1. In DigitalOcean App Platform:
   - Create a new static site
   - Connect to your GitHub repository
   - Select the `frontend` directory
   - Use build command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Use output directory: `build`
   - Configure environment variables (see frontend/.env.template)

2. Verify deployment:
   - Check that site loads correctly
   - Verify connection to backend API

## Pre-Deployment Verification

Run these scripts in their respective directories to check readiness:

```bash
# In backend directory
python check_deployment.py

# In frontend directory
node check_deployment.js
```

## Environment Variables

Remember that DigitalOcean App Platform will use environment variables set in its dashboard, not your local .env files. Make sure to configure all required variables during deployment!
