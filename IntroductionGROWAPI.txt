Authentication
Did this page help you?


Authentication
In our payment system, authentication is a critical aspect of every transaction. To ensure the smooth processing of payments, you must include two essential parameters with each payment request.

UserId
Unique Identifier: This parameter is a unique identifier assigned to every business connected to and using Grow Payment Solutions.

PageCode
Tailored Payment Experience: For each distinct payment type within your company, a unique pageCode is assigned. For example, credit card payments will have their designated pageCode, while Bit payments will have a separate one, and so on.

ImportantIt's important to remember that the pageCode and userId and apiKey in the testing environment differs from the live one.

For detailed information and additional options related to PageCodes, please refer to our comprehensive documentation



Supporting Multiple Business
If your company offers payment solutions to multiple other businesses, Grow can streamline your operations for your various clients.

For instance, a company that provides accounting services to multiple companies, should use the APIKey param.

ApiKey
‚óè Unique Company Identifier: The apiKey is a distinctive identifier linked to your company, connected to the respective userIds for each business you serve.

‚óè Example: To process payments for a specific client company, you'll use their designated userId, the appropriate pageCode, and the apiKey associated with your accounting services company.

Company Commission
For added flexibility, companies have the option to charge commissions for their services using the "companyCommission" parameter.

If you have any questions or require further assistance with authentication or any other aspect of our services, please don't hesitate to contact our dedicated support team.

Iframe vs Redirect
The differences between Iframe and Redirect

Redirect:
Redirect is a process that involves transferring the user from one web page to another in an absolute manner. This method is commonly used in payment processing or identity verification scenarios. When a user clicks a button or submits required information, they are redirected to another page, often with a different URL, where necessary actions are performed, and results are displayed.

Iframe:
Iframe is an HTML element that allows you to embed an entire web page or a specific portion of it within another web page. Typically, an iframe displays another page as a small, independent window while preserving the integrity of the main page. Iframes are commonly used when you need to display content from an external source within an existing page, such as external news or compact payment windows.

In summary, the key distinction between Redirect and Iframe lies in the user experience. In Redirect, the user is transferred to a new page, while in Iframe, the content is seamlessly displayed within the existing page.

Using Apple Pay with Iframe:
If you intend to use Apple Pay with an iframe, domain verification is a prerequisite. This verification process ensures the secure integration of Apple Pay into your web page.

üìò
Important Note:

When using an iframe, it's essential to employ post-messaging techniques to facilitate secure and efficient communication between different parts of the web page.



Success URL
After completing the transaction via the transaction form, the user will be redirected to a success page. They will be redirected to the link you have provided us during the initial creation request with a response parameter indicating a success. In this request, no actual details regarding the transaction will be sent. Only customer fields (cField), if there were any that have been pre-defined, will be sent. (All the transaction information will be passed upon update - Server to Server).

Success Url + cancel Url must be sent with each call,
Please note that you cannot send a local host address under this parameter,
We concatenate to the end of the URL the &reponse=success and the Cfields sent in the call
That's why you have to make an adjustment on your side to an address that matches these threads.

Upon Success

a success status would return inside the respone:
https://yoursite.co.il/return_url_with_params&reponse=success

example:
successUrl parameter is: <https://yoursite.co.il/?area=payment
The redirect URL will be: https://yoursite.co.il/area=payment&response=success

Upon Failure
The user would automatically be redirected back to the beginning of the payment process for them to retry completing the payment process again. (e.g. an error in the customer id number or CVV).


Bit Redirect
When dealing with Bit transactions, the process begins in browser for prepayment activities and subsequently shifts to the application for payment processing. Upon successful completion, customers are seamlessly redirected to the web browser to view their success message or payment confirmation. Please take note that for Bit transactions on mobile phones, it's imperative to set on full-screen mode.

There are three distinct redirection options following a successful Bit transaction:

Back to the Original Page:
‚óè If the original page is loaded in the default browser, the redirected page will appear as follows:


‚óè When the original page is not in the default browser, the redirected page will be displayed in the following manner:


Back to Original Browser::
‚óè i. If the transaction initially commenced in the default browser, users will be directed to a thank-you page.
‚óè ii. For transactions initiated in a non-default browser, the following page will be displayed:


Open in a New Tab (URL Accessible Anywhere):
‚óè Selecting this option opens a thank-you page in a new tab, allowing users to access it from their browser of choice.
At Grow, we are dedicated to ensuring a seamless and flexible experience for our customers. Should you have any questions or require further assistance regarding Bit transactions and redirection, please do not hesitate to contact our support team. Your satisfaction is our top priority.

Post Massage
At Grow we offer a comprehensive suite of features to enhance your payment processing experience. One such feature is the Post Message, which allows you to receive notification of events generated during a transaction and take actions as per your preferences.

Key Functions of PostMessage:
Transaction Completion Notification:
‚óè After payment, we provide dual notifications, one for the server and one for the browser.

‚óè The PostMessage effectively informs the browser that a transaction has been successfully completed.

Flexible PostMessage Handling:
‚óè In a new page definition, a PostMessage is sent to the newly opened tab.
‚óè When defining a process within a new page in the same browser, the PostMessage is sent to the newly created tab.
‚óè In a definition within the original tab, a PostMessage is directed back to the original tab.

Customizable Thank-You Pages:
Three distinct types of thank-you pages can be defined within the pageCode definition:

‚óè New Page: This type of thank-you page is designed as a completely new tab, independent of the original tab. It doesn't retrieve data from the original tab, and there's no ongoing process in the original tab waiting for the new page.

‚óè New Page in the Same Browser: Here, the thank-you page loads data from the original tab. Additionally, there may be a process in the original tab that is waiting for the new page to load.

‚óè The Original Tab: This refers to the tab from which the purchase was initially initiated. The thank-you page communicates directly with the original tab, completing the transaction loop.

PostMessage Event Codes:
Credit Card Transactions:
Success: payment

Failure: failed_to_load_page

Cancel (if user closed the tab): close

Bit
Success: bit_payment

Failure: ◊î◊ï◊ì◊¢◊î ◊ú◊ê ◊ß◊ô◊ô◊û◊™

Cancel (if user closed the tab): close

Close: bit_cancel

Apple Pay
Success: apple_payment

Failure: ◊î◊ï◊ì◊¢◊î ◊ú◊ê ◊ß◊ô◊ô◊û◊™

Cancel (if user closed the tab): close

Google Pay
Success: google_payment

Failure: ◊î◊ï◊ì◊¢◊î ◊ú◊ê ◊ß◊ô◊ô◊û◊™

Cancel (if user closed the tab): close

In Google Pay transactions, if you click on "X" or select another payment method, a PostMessage is generated without redirection to any cancel URL. In contrast, on other pages, a redirection may occur.

For detailed guidance on using the PostMessage feature, here's an example of code to help you get started:


window.addEventListener('message', function (result) {  
    if (result.origin === '<https://meshulam.co.il'> || result.origin === '<https://sandbox.meshulam.co.il'){>  
     switch (result.data.action){  
        case 'close' :{  
            document.getElementsByTagName('iframe')[0].style.setProperty('display','none');  
            break;  
        }  
        case 'payment' :{  
            if(result.data.status == 1){  
                // success  
            }  
            break;  
            }  
        case 'failed_to_load_page':{  
        break;  
        }  
    }  
 }  
});
At Grow, we are dedicated to ensuring a seamless and flexible experience for our customers. Should you have any questions or require further assistance regarding Bit transactions and redirection, please do not hesitate to contact our support team. Your satisfaction is our top priority.

Server Response
Server To Server
Server-To-Server Communication:
Our server-to-server service facilitates seamless communication with your server after a transaction is initiated. To ensure a smooth process, it is imperative that you send a response to Grow's server, confirming the receipt of our call. In the event that no response is received, our server will make additional attempts as follows:

‚óè 1-3 times after 10 minutes.

‚óè 4-5 times after 20 minutes.

‚óè 6 times after 30 minutes.
For example, the initial call occurs immediately after the transaction, followed by subsequent calls at 10-minute intervals. If no response is received by the sixth attempt, an email notification will be sent to your company to alert you of the communication issue.

Updating the server with the transaction's status and details would be performed by an HTTPS API method that you will be providing us when calling CreatePaymentProcess, in the notifyUrl param.

This URL is an endpoint in your site, which Grow's server will call to update you about the transaction. When received this call (you could save data to DB etc. and then) you should call ApproveTransaction.

The method takes in parameters as an HTTP POST, the same way as you would send the data to the CreatePaymentProcess method and NOT as JSON

Approve Transaction
Upon the completion of the payment process, it is crucial to inform Grow that a response has been received and the transaction process was successfully completed.
Transaction Approval Method:
To officially approve the transaction, utilise the approveTransaction method at the conclusion of the process. This step involves sending the pageCode and all data received frome the server update.

Important Notes:
‚óè This step does not alter the transaction status nor does it cancel or approve it; the charging process proceeds as planned.
‚óè It is a critical component of the overall process and must be performed for every successful transaction.
‚óè Do not send this request in the case of token transactions (created with createTransactionWithToken) or delayed transactions (J4J5), or for save token only scenarios.

SDK Growin
This SDK comes to create a new, modular and designed payment process.
Our purpose is to give you an easy solution for online payments without having to redirect or open iframes that may not provide the best user experience and limit your overall flexibility.

üìò
NOTE:

This SDK is designed to work in conjunction with the server-side ‚ÄòcreatePaymentProcess‚Äô method that should be configured to work with a pageCode that is set to SDK wallet mode.

The payment is valid for 10 minutes from the moment the createPaymentProcess call was made
That's why we recommend sending the call only after opening a payment form and not at an earlier stage of the process

Once ‚ÄòcreatePaymentProcess‚Äô method return an authCode

You can use to open the wallet on Client side with ‚ÄòrenderPaymentOptions‚Äô method.
there is no 3ds.

Explanation of assimilation :
This SDK comes to create a new, modular and designed payment process.
Our purpose is to give you an easy solution for online payments without having to redirect or open iframes that may not provide the best user experience and limit your overall flexibility.

Note: This SDK is designed to work in conjunction with the server-side ‚ÄòcreatePaymentProcess‚Äô method that should be configured to work with a pageCode that is set to SDK wallet mode.

To use the SDK, you first need to load the SDK into your webpage in the following way:


The scripts ‚Äòonload‚Äô event should point to a function that configures the wallet:







Once the payment process is triggered by the user (e.g user clicks checkout button) you need to run the server side ‚ÄòcreatePaymentProcess‚Äô method which will return an authCode which you can use to open the wallet with the SDK‚Äôs ‚ÄòrenderPaymentOptions‚Äô method.
An example of how to initiate the method:

// response - the response you received from 'createPaymentProcess'
if (response.status && growPayment) {
growPayment.renderPaymentOptions(response.authCode);
}

Once the wallet is opened, use the callback events to handle the rest of the flow.

Important: The wallet has a limited validity time which starts once you call the backend ‚ÄòcreatePaymentProcess‚Äô api method. Therefore, it‚Äôs best to call the ‚ÄòcreatePaymentProcess‚Äô backend api method right before you need to render the wallet to make sure users do not experience a wallet timeout during the payment process.

Note: Once renderPaymentOptions is called there will be a period in which the SDK must make an API call to Grow backend before the wallet is visually rendered. It is recommended to use the onWalletChange event to know when the wallet is about to open in order to handle your loader state.

Here is sample of response from the server:

JSON

{
  "status": 1,
  "err": "",
  "data": {
    "processId": 413133,
    "processToken": "92ab69240c00aa073eb818dc646e2c32",
    "authCode": "beb1064aa495042a69c9c5e2dc384180%NDEzMTM0"
  }
}
Here is sample of implementation un client side:

JavaScript

// response - the response you received from 'createPaymentProcess'
if (response.status && growPayment) {
   growPayment.renderPaymentOptions(response.authCode);
}

üìò
Note

The wallet will be invalid after 4 min.

All scripts must be implemented in the frontend.



NFC
Procedure for Setting Up the NFC Service:

 Download the Grow application from Google Play Store.
 Purchase the service and notify us to receive the code for your device.
 Send this code as a parameter in the "createPaymentProcess" call under the name "deviceKey."
 In transaction broadcasts to the device, use the unique pageCode for this transaction provided by the Grow service.
Steps to Perform a Transaction:

Execute a "createPaymentProcess" call with the designated "pageCode" for the transaction and the "deviceKey" of the selected broadcasting device.
Open the URL sent after the call where transaction details will appear on the application screen.
Opening the URL - Important Notes:

Before making the call, ensure our application is open on the home page, in a waiting state.
For example

After making the "createPaymentProcess" call, you will receive a URL in response.
This URL should be opened and not closed until the process is completed !
In other words, the link received from the call should be opened on a device separate from the one where the application is open and should remain open until the transaction is finished.
The next screen must remain open:

Credit card pairing transactions (pairing a credit card to the back of the phone) are limited to an amount of up to 300 NIS. Digital wallet pairing transactions (phone-to-phone) have no amount limitations.
Business owners can broadcast to multiple devices, meaning they should be able to select from a list which device they want to broadcast to, with support for multiple device keys.
The application screen during transmission:


NOTE:

üìò
Important Note:

Broadcasting to an active device should only be done within the live environment.
After Transaction:
Receive an update from the server confirming that the transaction was successfully completed.
Initiate a call to "approve" that updates you upon receiving the server's update, indicating awareness of the transaction.
For business owners, the ability to broadcast to multiple devices is supported. They can select from a list which device they want to broadcast to, with support for multiple device keys.


3DS
Enhance the security of your transactions with the Grow 3DS service, a robust defence against fraudulent activities.

This service operates by sending a unique code to the updated mobile number registered with the credit card company of the cardholder each time a transaction is initiated.
Post-Purchase Activation:

Upon purchasing the 3DS service, experience the following benefits:
‚óè Automated Activation: The service seamlessly activates for any transaction conducted within a subscription, giving you control over the specified transaction amount.
‚óè Universal Activation: Enjoy the peace of mind that comes with the 3DS service, active for every transaction by default.

Managing Service Preferences:
‚óè To tailor the service to your needs, when calling the api ,utilize the "cancel3DS=True" parameter to deactivate the service for specific transactions.

Overview
This API initiates a standard payment process and returns a secure URL for the transaction form.

The apiKey, userId and pageCode parameters are provided by Grow during the onboarding process



The flow:





Important Notes
The URL will be valid for 10 min.
The transaction will be processed even if the Approve Transaction request is not executed or fails.
Due to URL length restrictions in the browser, restricted to 2000 characters, it is possible that not all Optional fields would return on requesting the Thank You page. ( On a request made to the server all fields will return).
The successUrl and the optional fields must contain valid characters. In case you are interested in sending different parameters, it is recommended that you would use encryption of base64 or a similar one to it.
In case of using Post Message, the successUrl and cancelUrl are not required.
In case of using iFrame, please see iFrame section. iframe info
To receive the invoice via webhook, set the invoiceNotifyUrl parameter with your endpoint.
The successUrl and cancelUrl must point to external URLs. localhost is not allowed.
When using an iFrame, ensure that the URL uses HTTPS rather than HTTP.

üìò
Important

Only server-side requests are allowed. Any client-side (browser-based) requests will be blocked.
